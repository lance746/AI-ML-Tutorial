### what is machine learning?
A machine learning algorithm is a set of instructions that enables a computer to learn from data, make predictions, and improve its performance over time. It's a key component of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to automatically:

    1. Learn from data
    2. Identify patterns
    3. Make decisions
    4. Predict outcomes



### Supervised Learning:
Trained on labeled data to predict outcomes (e.g., spam detection, image classification)

### Unsupervised Learning: 
Trained on unlabeled data to discover patterns (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction)

`In non-exclusive (or overlapping) clustering, objects may be assigned to multiple clusters. For instance, a grouping of people by age and sex is exclusive whereas a grouping by disease category is nonexclusive since a person can have several diseases at the same time`

### Reinforcement Learning: 
Trained through trial and error to make decisions (e.g., game playing, robotics)
