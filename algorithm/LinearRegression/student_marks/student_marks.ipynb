    "1. Continuous target variable: Use LinearRegression when the target variable is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices, stock prices, temperatures).\n",
    "2. Linear relationships: Use LinearRegression when the relationship between features and the target variable is linear or can be approximated as linear.\n",
    "3. Simple models: Use LinearRegression for simple models where interpretability is important (e.g., understanding the impact of each feature on the target variable).\n",
    "4. Small to medium-sized datasets: LinearRegression is suitable for small to medium-sized datasets where computational efficiency is important.\n"
